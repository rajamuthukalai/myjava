A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.

Vertices are the nodes of the graph.
Edges are the arcs that connect pairs of vertices.
Unweighted graph is a graph not having a weight associated with any edge.
Weighted graph is a graph having a weight associated with each edge.
Undirected graph is a graph where edges do not have a direction associated with them.
Directed graph is a graph where edges have a direction associated with them.
Cyclic graph is a graph having at least one loop.
Acyclic graph is a graph having no loop.
Tree is a special case of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
